# Bionic Reading Chrome Extension - Developer Specification

## Overview

This Chrome extension automatically applies Bionic Reading to any website by bolding the first few letters of every word in main content areas. The extension will be simple to use, with a keyboard shortcut for activation and a visual indicator of its active state. The goal is to improve readability and comprehension while maintaining simplicity and browser compatibility.

## 1. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Global Application:**  
  The extension applies Bionic Reading across the entire page, modifying the text in main content areas. It should exclude non-readable elements like forms, buttons, and navigation bars.

- **Activation & Toggle:**  
  The extension should be activated via the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Alt + B` (Mac). This toggles the Bionic Reading effect on and off for the page.

- **Dynamic Content Handling:**  
  As new content appears (e.g., in infinite scrolling), the extension should automatically apply the Bionic Reading effect to the newly loaded text.

- **Error Handling:**  
  The extension should notify the user if it fails to apply the Bionic Reading effect, with clear error messages shown in the popup UI.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**  
  The extension must be compatible with all modern browsers that support Chrome extensions (primarily Chrome and Edge).
  
- **Performance:**  
  The extension should be lightweight and responsive, with minimal impact on page load times and scrolling performance.

## 2. Architecture & Design Choices

### Heuristic Content Detection

- The extension will detect the main content areas of the page using heuristics based on common HTML structures:
  - Look for `<article>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and other large blocks of text.
  - Avoid non-content areas like navigation bars, forms, comments, and input fields.

- **Flexibility:**  
  The heuristics will be designed to be forgiving, targeting most readable content while minimizing unnecessary bolding of UI elements.

### Bionic Reading Effect

- **Bolding Behavior:**  
  - Bold the first few letters of every word using `font-weight: bold;`.
  - Apply to every word without exceptions (no stop-words filtering).

- **CSS Override Strategy:**  
  If a website uses custom fonts or dynamic CSS that conflicts with the bolding effect, the extension will attempt to override those styles using inline CSS.

### Error Handling

- **Error Detection:**  
  - The extension will check for issues while processing the DOM (e.g., unsupported page structures).
  
- **User Notification:**  
  - When an error occurs (e.g., the extension fails to apply bolding), the popup will display a clear error message, such as “Unable to apply Bionic Reading on this page.”

### Icon Update & Feedback

- **Inactive State:**  
  The extension icon will display a lowercase "b" when inactive.

- **Active State:**  
  The icon will change to a bold uppercase "B" when the extension is active.

- **Popup UI:**  
  The popup will include a tutorial or help section explaining how to use the extension and a message area for error reporting.

## 3. Data Handling

### Privacy

- **No Tracking:**  
  The extension will not track any user data or interactions. It operates entirely on the client side with no external data collection or analytics.

### User Settings

- **No Customization Initially:**  
  The extension will not include customizable settings (e.g., bolding intensity, word exceptions) at launch. All settings are predefined.

## 4. Implementation Details

### Keyboard Shortcut Activation

- **Fixed Shortcut:**  
  - The default keyboard shortcut for toggling the Bionic Reading effect is `Ctrl + Alt + B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Alt + B` (Mac).
  - The shortcut can be implemented using Chrome's `commands` API.

- **Toggle Behavior:**  
  Pressing the shortcut should toggle the Bionic Reading effect on the page:
  - If the effect is off, the extension should start applying the bolding effect to the page.
  - If the effect is on, pressing the shortcut again should remove the bolding.

### Content Detection & Bionic Reading Application

- **DOM Traversal:**  
  - Use `document.querySelectorAll()` to select the main content areas based on heuristics (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`, `<p>`, etc.).
  - Apply the bolding effect to each word in the content using regular expressions to break up the text into individual words.

- **Handling Dynamically Loaded Content:**  
  - Use a MutationObserver to detect when new content is added to the page (e.g., during infinite scroll or AJAX updates).
  - Automatically apply the Bionic Reading effect to the newly added content.

### Error Handling & Notifications

- **Error Logging:**  
  - Log errors in the browser console for debugging purposes.
  - Display error messages in the popup UI, e.g., “Unable to process this page.”

### Icon Update Logic

- **Active/Inactive States:**  
  - Use `chrome.browserAction` or `chrome.action` APIs to update the extension icon dynamically.
  - When Bionic Reading is active, change the icon to a bold uppercase "B"; when inactive, display a lowercase "b".

## 5. Testing Plan

### Functional Testing

- **Activation Test:**  
  Verify that pressing `Ctrl + Alt + B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Alt + B` (Mac) correctly toggles the Bionic Reading effect on and off.

- **Content Detection Test:**  
  Verify that the extension correctly detects main content areas and applies the bolding effect to all words within those areas.

- **Dynamic Content Test:**  
  Test that new content (e.g., from infinite scroll) automatically gets the bolding effect applied.

- **Error Handling Test:**  
  Ensure the extension displays appropriate error messages in the popup UI when it encounters issues, such as unsupported content or failure to modify the text.

### Compatibility Testing

- **Cross-Site Testing:**  
  Test the extension on a variety of websites, including news sites, blogs, and social media platforms, to ensure it applies the Bionic Reading effect as expected.

- **Browser Compatibility Test:**  
  Ensure the extension works on Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers.

### Performance Testing

- **Page Load Test:**  
  Measure the extension's impact on page load times and overall responsiveness.
  
- **Scrolling Test:**  
  Ensure that scrolling and dynamically loaded content (infinite scroll) are processed smoothly.

### Edge Case Testing

- **Non-Content Areas:**  
  Ensure that navigation bars, forms, buttons, and other non-content areas are excluded from the bolding effect.

- **CSS Conflicts Test:**  
  Test on pages with complex custom fonts and styles to ensure the extension overrides those styles effectively.

## 6. Deployment Plan

- **Packaging:**  
  - Package the extension as a .zip file and upload it to the Chrome Web Store for distribution.
  
- **Installation:**  
  Users can install the extension directly from the Chrome Web Store or from a local .crx file during development.

---

## 7. Future Enhancements

- **Customization Options:**  
  Future releases can include settings to allow users to adjust the number of bolded letters, disable certain websites, or apply specific styling.

- **Multi-Language Support:**  
  Consider adding localization for the UI and instructions in multiple languages if the extension gains a large user base.
