# Bionic Reading Chrome Extension - TODO Checklist

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Configuration ✅

- [x] **Create Project Folder Structure:**
  - [x] `manifest.json`
  - [x] `background.js`
  - [x] `content.js`
  - [x] `popup.html`
  - [x] `popup.js`
  - [x] `styles.css`
  - [x] `icons/`

- [x] **Create Manifest File (`manifest.json`):**
  - [x] Define manifest version (`manifest_version: 3`).
  - [x] Set extension name and description.
  - [x] Set permissions for active tab (`"activeTab"`) and scripting.
  - [x] Configure background script (`background.js`).
  - [x] Set up content script for all URLs.
  - [x] Define keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Alt+B` or `Cmd+Alt+B`).
  - [x] Define the extension icon and popup UI.

## Phase 2: Keyboard Shortcut and Toggle Logic ✅

- [x] **Implement Keyboard Shortcut Handling:**
  - [x] Set up Chrome `commands` API to listen for the toggle shortcut (`Ctrl + Alt + B` / `Cmd + Alt + B`).
  - [x] Create function to toggle Bionic Reading on the active tab.

- [x] **Create `toggleBionicReading` Function:**
  - [x] Implement function to toggle Bionic Reading effect.
  - [x] Add state tracking for active/inactive status.

## Phase 3: Content Detection and Bionic Reading Effect ✅

- [x] **Set Up Content Detection Logic:**
  - [x] Use `document.querySelectorAll()` to select main content areas (`<article>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<p>`).
  - [x] Define regular expression to split text into words.

- [x] **Apply Bold Effect to Text:**
  - [x] Create logic to apply bolding to the first few letters of each word.
  - [x] Ensure the rest of the word remains unmodified.

- [x] **Integrate Bold Effect with Toggle:**
  - [x] Modify `toggleBionicReading` to call `applyBionicReading` when the effect is active.
  - [x] Implement content restoration when toggling off.

## Phase 4: Dynamic Content Handling ✅

- [x] **Use MutationObserver to Detect Dynamic Content:**
  - [x] Implement a MutationObserver to track changes in the DOM (e.g., infinite scrolling, AJAX updates).
  - [x] Automatically apply Bionic Reading to newly loaded content.

## Phase 5: Error Handling and Notifications ✅

- [x] **Error Handling in `applyBionicReading`:**
  - [x] Add try-catch block around the content processing logic.
  - [x] Log errors to the console for debugging.

- [x] **Send Error Notifications to Popup:**
  - [x] Send error messages to the popup when an error occurs (e.g., "Unable to apply Bionic Reading").
  - [x] Handle error messages in `popup.js`.

## Phase 6: Popup UI and Icon Update ✅

- [x] **Create Popup UI:**
  - [x] Set up basic HTML structure (`popup.html`).
  - [x] Add a button to toggle Bionic Reading.
  - [x] Add an error message area (`<p id="error-message">`).
  - [x] Add example section showing before/after.

- [x] **Handle Popup Button Interaction:**
  - [x] Implement JavaScript (`popup.js`) to toggle Bionic Reading when the button is clicked.
  - [x] Use message passing to trigger the toggle in the active tab.

- [x] **Update Extension Icon Based on Active/Inactive State:**
  - [x] Create SVG icons for active and inactive states.
  - [x] Implement icon switching logic in background script.

## Phase 7: Testing and Debugging ✅

- [x] **Create Testing Guide:**
  - [x] Create comprehensive testing guide (`TESTING.md`).
  - [x] Include test cases for all major functionality.
  - [x] Include performance and cross-browser testing instructions.

- [ ] **Functional Testing:**
  - [ ] Test that `Ctrl + Alt + B` / `Cmd + Alt + B` correctly toggles Bionic Reading.
  - [ ] Test the Bionic Reading effect on various websites (news, blogs, etc.).
  - [ ] Test that the toggle logic works (on/off behavior).
  
- [ ] **Dynamic Content Testing:**
  - [ ] Test the extension on pages with infinite scrolling (e.g., social media, news sites).
  - [ ] Verify that new content (via AJAX or infinite scroll) is processed and bolding is applied.

- [ ] **Error Handling Testing:**
  - [ ] Test that errors are correctly logged and displayed in the popup.
  - [ ] Test invalid or unsupported content scenarios (e.g., complex page structures).

- [ ] **Performance Testing:**
  - [ ] Measure page load times and ensure minimal impact.
  - [ ] Ensure smooth scrolling performance.
  
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing:**
  - [ ] Test the extension in Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers.
  - [ ] Ensure functionality is consistent across these browsers.

## Phase 8: Packaging and Deployment ✅

- [x] **Prepare for Packaging:**
  - [x] Clean up the project folder (remove unused files).
  - [x] Create icon generation scripts (`icons/generate_pngs.js`, `icons/simple_icons.js`, `icons/direct_png.js`).
  - [x] Create packaging script (`package.js`).

- [x] **Create Installation Guide:**
  - [x] Create comprehensive installation guide (`INSTALLATION.md`).
  - [x] Include Chrome Web Store installation instructions.
  - [x] Include manual installation instructions.
  - [x] Include troubleshooting tips.

- [ ] **Package the Extension:**
  - [ ] Generate PNG icons using one of the provided scripts.
  - [ ] Run the packaging script to create the distribution ZIP.
  - [ ] Upload to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.
  - [ ] Complete the Chrome Web Store listing (description, screenshots, etc.).

- [ ] **Test the Installation:**
  - [ ] Test installation from the Chrome Web Store.
  - [ ] Test manual installation using the distribution ZIP.

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] **Monitor User Feedback:**
  - [ ] Check for user reviews and any reported issues.
  - [ ] Address bug reports or feature requests if necessary.

- [ ] **Future Enhancements (Optional):**
  - [ ] Implement user settings for customizations (e.g., bolding intensity).
  - [ ] Add support for multi-language UI.
  - [ ] Implement more fine-tuned content detection heuristics for improved accuracy.
